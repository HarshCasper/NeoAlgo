# Roadmap for Data Structures and Algorithms



We as a whole realize that Data structures and Algorithms are the foundation of each idea we use. There are numerous ideas engaged with Data structures and calculations. There will be numerous inquiries for an amateur like how to begin learning DSA, as there are numerous ideas included and he/she may get befuddled toward the beginning. In this post, we will see a guide for learning DSA. I am not saying that this is the ideal guide for DSA. You can utilize your own arrangements additionally yet this is only a thought.

The core Fundamentals of Computer science, the power of knowing what happens behind the scenes, the very compact and controllable space and performance, for example, the right Decisions of choosing the best Data structure to organize and store some specific kind of data, knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each one,

e.g. the deep understanding of the differences between Arrays, Lists, Multimaps, Heap, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs and so on and so forth, So we should get started.

# Language Selection
Pick any programming language of your choice. If you want to build DSA from scratch, I'll suggest.
- [C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/?ref=leftbar)
- [C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/?ref=leftbar)
