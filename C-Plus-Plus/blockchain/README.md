# **Introduction to Blockchain** 
The blockchain is a distributed database of records of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction is verified by the majority of participants of the system and contains every single record of each transaction.
In simpler words, when we create a PowerPoint and share it with a group of people, the PowerPoint is distributed instead of being copied. This creates a decentralized system in which everyone gets access to the ppt and can make changes in real-time

Blockchain Technology records Transaction in a digital ledger which is distributed over the Network thus making it incorruptible and more secure.
# Features of blockchain:-
- Consensus
- Provenance 
- Immutability
- Finality
## Consensus
Blockchain provides a decentralized system where all participants agree for the transaction to be held. It is used to achieve the necessary agreement on the single data value. Thus, a consensus algorithm aims at finding a common agreement that is a win for the entire network.
## Provenance
All the participants taking part in the network knows about the history of the transaction data.
Example: - How ownership changes every time.
It enables businesses to collate their data, and also verify key information. It gathers product information and tracks product journeys in a way that is secure, trustworthy and accessible by using  tokens .Many refer to this process as tokenization because it effectively creates a blockchain-backed token that you can trade between artists and collectors.
## Immutability
Blockchain is an immutable database, and you cannot manipulate data that's already in the blockchain. The hash value is unique, identifying one block. So each block has its unique hash value, and it’s identifying this block only. It is the key advantage of using Blockchain Technology in Business.
Each block of information, such as facts or transaction details, proceed using a cryptographic principle or a hash value.
## Finality
It refers to the assurance that transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed. Once the transaction is committed to the Blockchain it can't be reversed means It can't be rolled back to its previous state.

# Types of Blockchain

## Public Blockchain 
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e.,participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).Example of public blockchain are
- Bitcoin Blockchain:- It is an example of an unpermissioned, public blockchain. 
- Ethereum blockchain

## Private Blockchain
A private blockchain is permissioned.One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. A consensus of replicated, shared and synchronized digital data commonly known as distributed ledger is used in private blockchain. It is controlled by a central authority(partially decentralized) thus it is more vulnerable to fault transactions.
Some examples of private blockchains are the
- Business-to-business virtual currency exchange network Ripple
- Hyperledger, an umbrella project of open-source blockchain applications.

## Hybrid Blockchain 
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization decentralization are used.
- An example of a hybrid blockchain is IBM Food Trust, which was developed to improve efficiency throughout the whole food supply chain.

## Consortium Blockchain
A consortium blockchain is a permissioned blockchain governed by a group of organizations, rather than one entity as in private blockchain. It provides more levels of security than private and hybrid blockchain . Setting up a consortium involves logistical challenges as well as potential antitrust risk due to a cooperation between a number of organizations.

- A popular set of consortium blockchain solutions for the financial services industry and beyond has been developed by the enterprise software firm R3.  In the supply chain sector, CargoSmart has developed the Global Shipping Business Network Consortium, a not-for-profit blockchain consortium which aims to digitalize the shipping industry and allow maritime industry operators to work more collaboratively.

# Ledger
It is a book or a collections of financial accounts and transactions. Blockchain uses a distributed public ledger.
Distributed ledger is am consesus of replicated, shared and syncronized digital data where is no centralized administrator.Its database is spread across several nodes (devices) on a peer-to-peer network, where each replicates and saves an identical copy of the ledger and updates itself independently. The primary advantage is the lack of central authority. When a ledger update happens, each node constructs the new transaction, and then the nodes vote by consensus algorithm on which copy is correct. Once a consensus has been determined, all the other nodes update themselves with the new, correct copy of the ledger.Security is accomplished through cryptographic keys and signatures.

# Types of Ledger:- Permissioned Ledger and Unpermissionaed Ledger

## Permissioned ledger
Permissioned ledger is going to involve the consensus( a general agreement) upon the transaction that occurs on that ledger. Only certain participants are deciding on what transactions happen.eg:- Ripple and the Hyperledger modules. They are less decentralized and they are generally faster. It is generally going to be faster because you are not waiting to mine or build blocks out.  You have a static group of parties that are deciding on what transactions are going to be on it.

## Unpermissioned ledger
With an unpermissioned ledger, anyone can change the ledger and this is an important distinction because this is what drives speculation in the cryptocurrency markets now. When we talk about Bitcoin, this is an unpermissioned ledger. Anybody can buy a Bitcoin, anyone can make changes to the ledger, anyone can get a coin which is an access code basically to this system and they can trade value between other people with it. What that enables us to do now is speculate on the value of it because anyone is allowed in. This is what drives most of the cryptos and initial coin offerings that are in the space now.  All of these blockchains are unpermissioned ledgers.

# Blockchain in Business and Banking Industry
Impact of blockchain is inevitable as blockchain has so many cases and more hasn't been found yet.They are many ways by which blockchain can improve the current transactions method by making it more secure. The most visible ways are crypto-loans, financial record keeping, complete transparency, distributed public ledger.
These are just some of the ways in which blockchain has had an impact on the banking sector. In actuality, there are many smaller ways this impact has been felt by the financial institutions and investors. The very fact that legendary banks like Barcley’s bank are investing so much in adopting blockchain technology is sufficient that how much in demand the blockchain is. 
Blockchain technology also developing transparency to business processes and ethical codes, such as honesty, consideration, and responsibility, which lead to accurate tracking of executive services and valuation of organizational assets.The distributable blockchain system builds a strong technocratic power structure, and the use of hash and encryption functions promotes social trust and network-level coordination this leads.The technology allows a secure way for individuals to deal directly with each other, without an intermediary like a government, bank or other third party.Thus It can affect the way information is exchanged and create transparency in the organization.

# Cryptocurrency and Its Impact in near future
Due to the world progressing towards digitisation and availability of high speed network connectivity across the world, cryptocurrencies have come out to be a new rave for investors and industries. Especially the past year has been very significant for blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. Today the net worth of cryptocurrencies is  $1.5 trillion, which is increasing at a faster rate. In a few years, it will be the most popular technology.
Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques like elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, hashing functions, etc.

## Bitcoin - A virtual currency
The 2000s saw an increase in demand for virtual currency that is more secure. A decentralized way of transaction that can replace the central authority like the Federal Reserve is the centralized authority and the repository for US dollars, GS&R - the company behind E-Gold and the traditional banking system for transactions.
### Features
- It is an unpermissioned, public blockchain.
- The arrival of Bitcoin in 2009 - the first and, arguably, most famous decentralized virtual currency - had a significant impact.
- Instead of using a centralized ledger that most traditional government banks use, it uses a public ledger known as the blockchain.
- Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to a network of privately operated nodes running Bitcoin software. They are verified, processed into groups called blocks. All nodes keep a record of these blocks once they have been processed, thus maintaining a distributed record of transactions and ownership.
