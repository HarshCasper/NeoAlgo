Problem Link:https://www.codechef.com/problems/MAXSCOR

*There are N chapters and only K minutes are left before the exam. 
*Chapter i will be worth Mi marks in the exam, and shall take Ti minutes to study. 
*Person can study the chapters in any order but needs to study them completely and at most once.
*He knows that he will forget the first chapter that he will prepare (due to lack of sleep) 
 and wonâ€™t be able to score any marks in it. 
*Find the maximum marks that person can score in the exam.

**Input:
*First line is T, number of testcases.
*Each testcase contain N+1 lines of input.
*First line contains 2 space separated integers N and K
 total number of chapters and total time left before the exam respectively.
*Each of the next N lines contain 2 space separated integers Mi and Ti w
 eightage and time for the ith chapter respectively.

**Output: Maximum score.
