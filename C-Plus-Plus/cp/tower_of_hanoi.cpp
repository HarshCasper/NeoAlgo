/* Tower Of Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. 
Objective:to move the entire stack to another rod using the below rules:
*Only one disk can be moved at a time.
*Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack 
*No disk must be placed on top of a smaller disk.
