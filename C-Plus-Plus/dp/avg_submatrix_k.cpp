Problem Statement:
For a matrix of order n X m, with non-decreasing elements both along rows and columns, 
A "successful submatrix for K" is a square submatrix of A, i.e. a submatrix with n row 
and n column, for any integer n, such that the average of all the integers in this submatrix is â‰¥ K.
Find the number of such possible successful submatrices for given K.

Algorithm:
1. Preprocess matrix A such that every element in the auxiliary matrix contains the sum of all the elements 
preceding it (row-wise & column-wise)... ie, aux[i][j] stores sum of elements from (0,0) to (i,j).

2. Thereby, sum of the required submatrix can be found dynamically using : 
aux(bottom_right) - aux(bottom_left) - aux(top_right) + aux(top_left)
