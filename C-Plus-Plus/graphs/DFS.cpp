/* 
What is DFS?
Depth-first searchis an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root
and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. A version of depth-first search was
investigated in the 19th century French mathematician Charles Pierre Tr√©maux as a strategy for solving mazes.
Depth-first search is a systematic way to find all the vertices reachable from a source vertex. Like breadth-first
search, 
DFS traverse a connected component of a given graph and defines a spanning tree. 
The basic idea of depth-first search is methodically exploring every edge. We start over from a different vertices as necessary. As soon as
we discover a vertex, DFS starts exploring from it

//STEPS:
/*
Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty
