/*
Top view of binary tree

Given a binary tree, print the nodes in left to right manner as visible from above the tree.
Input is given in order of root left child then right child.
For e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Tree looks like 
              1
          /      \
      2           3
    /     \       /
  4       5     6
   
nodes '5' and '6' will be overlapped by '1' as seen from above, 
so when viewed from the top , we would see the nodes 4, 2, 1 and 3.

/*
Sample Input:
Enter the root value: 1
Enter the left and right childs : 2 3
Enter the left and right childs : 4 5
Enter the left and right childs : 6 -1
Enter the left and right childs : -1 -1
Enter the left and right childs : -1 -1
Enter the left and right childs : -1 -1

Sample Output:
Top view: 4 2 1 3 

Time Complexity:  O(n), for traversing the nodes

Space Complexity: O(n), since queue has been used for n nodes
