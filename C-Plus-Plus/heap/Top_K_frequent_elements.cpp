/*
Top K frequent Elements
======================================
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/

Steps:
1.We will build a map and store frequency of every element in the array.
2.We will push all the elements of map along with their frequencies in a maxHeap as a pair. 
3.Now, elements are sorted in descending order based on the first element of the pair.
4.Therefore, we will make the pair as {frequency of the element, element}.
5.We will run a loop till k is greater than 0 and maxHeap is not empty, pop the elements and print them.

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.

 // Take input
 int n; 
 cin >> n;
 vector<int> nums(n);
 for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
 cin >> nums[i];
 }
 int k;
 cin >> k;
 topKFrequent(nums, k);

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(n)

Input: 
n = 8
nums = [1,1,7,4,2,2,2,3]
k = 2
Output: [2,1]

Explanation:
Top 2 frequent elements are 2 and 1 as 2 occurs 3 times and 1 occurs 2 times.
