/*
In this code, we will see how to count number of bits in a number. 
We are given a number and we have to count the number of bits in its binary representation.
For count number of bits in a number, we follow the following algorithm:
First, we convert the number into its binary representation.
Count number of bits in binary representation.
Print the value of count.

// C++ Program
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

   int count=0;
   
   // counting number of bits in binary representation of number
   while(n!=0)

  // Taking number as input

  // Printing count of bits of given number
  cout<<"No. of bits: "<<count_bits(n)<<endl;

/*

Input:
Enter the number: 10

Output:
No. of bits: 4


Input:
Enter the number: 3

Output:
No. of bits: 2

Time Complexity: O(logn)
Space Complexity: O(1)
where n is the number of elements.
