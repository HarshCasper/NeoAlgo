/* This is a preferred approach to count no. of set bits of a digit.
   Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm:
   Concept -> If we subtract 1 from a decimal number, it will flip all the bits
   after the rightmost set bit i.e 1 including that rightmost bit too.
   As 10 is 0000 1010, 9 is 0000 1001
   you can see in above example rightmost set bit in 10 is at second position
   therefore in number (10 - 1) = 9 that second position and after that 1st position
   flips away. 
   So, we do bitwise of n and (n-1), then we unset the rightmost unset bit and we set
   a counter to count the number of times loop executes we set bit count.   
   In brief, no. of times loop runs is equal to count of set bits.
