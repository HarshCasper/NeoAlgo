/*Russian Reasant Algorithm

In this algorithm, two numbers are multiplied without using multiplication operator.
We double the first number and halve the second number repeatedly till the second number doesnâ€™t become 1. 
In the process, whenever the second number becomes odd, we add the first number to result.

In the 1800s, Peasants in a remote area of Russia were discovered multiplying numbers using this remarkably unusual process.
