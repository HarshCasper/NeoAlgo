/*
Stock Span Problem
===================
You are given the price of a stock for N consecutive days and are required to find the span
of stock's price on ith day. The span of a stock's price on a given day i, is the maximum
consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which the stock's price is less than equal to that on
the ith day.

Application: Stack data structure

#include<iostream>
#include<stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {

	// Input number of days
	int n; cin >> n;
	int price[n];
	int span[n];

	// Input price for n days
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> price[i];
	}

	// Stack for keeping track of span of largest element till now
	stack<pair<int, int>> s;
	// Push first element in the stack
	s.push({1, price[0]});
	// Span for first day will always be 1
	span[0] = 1;

	// Looping through rest of the days
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		// Initally the curr span of a day will be 1, i.e, itself
		int currSpan = 1;
		int currPrice = price[i];

		// Taking the topmost element in the stack
		auto p = s.top();
		int topSpan = p.first;
		int topPrice = p.second;

		// While we have elements in the stack and currPrice is greater than equal to topPrice
		// keeping popping out elements and update the currSpan
		while (s.size() && topPrice <= currPrice) {

			// Update currSpan
			currSpan += topSpan;

			// Pop out the topmost element as its price was less than currPrice
			s.pop();

			// Update top element after popping
			if (s.size()) {
				p = s.top();
				topSpan = p.first;
				topPrice = p.second;
			} else {
				// Stack is empty
				break;
			}
		}

		// Finally update ans
		span[i] = currSpan;
		// Push curr element into the stack
		s.push({currSpan, currPrice});
	}

	// Print ans
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cout << span[i] << " ";
	}
