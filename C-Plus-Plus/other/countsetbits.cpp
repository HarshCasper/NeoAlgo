/* 
Normal & Simple Approach
Loop through all bits in an integer, check if a bit is set and if it is then increment the set bit count.

/*
Sample Input : n = 9
Sample Output : Number of set bits or 1s in the number is : 2
Explanation: Binary representation of 9 is 1001 and has 2 set bits
Time Complexity: (-)(logn) (Theta of logn)
