/*Bubble Sort Algorithm is the simplest sorting algorithm in which each element is compared to its adjacent element

The swapping occurs till the array is sorted.

/*
// Input
Enter the number of elements of the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array to be sorted:
1
2
3
6
5

// Ouput
Array after sorting is:
1 2 3 5 6

Time complexities:
	Worst Case:O(n2) -When we have to sort the array in opposite order as 
					 compared to given like ascending to descending. 
    Best Case:O(n)   - When the array is already sorted.
    Average Case:O(n2) - When elements are in jumbled order.

Space Complexity: Auxilary Space:O(2) because of variable temp and sorted.
