/*
In this algorithm we keep halving one number and doubling the 2nd one.
While halving, if we get an odd number, we add the 2nd doubled number to the result.
This goes on until the halving makes the first reach 0.
It is also known as the Ancient Egyptian Multiplication, used by
scribes to do multiplication without using the multiplication table.
