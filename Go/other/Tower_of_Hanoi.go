/*
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
In this code, we use the recursive definition of Tower of Hanoi.
Time Complexity: O(2^N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

INPUT: 4

OUTPUT:
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 3
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 3 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 3
Shifting disk from rod 2 to rod 1
Shifting disk from rod 2 to rod 3
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 3
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 3 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 3 to rod 1
Shifting disk from rod 2 to rod 1
Shifting disk from rod 3 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 3
Shifting disk from rod 1 to rod 2
Shifting disk from rod 3 to rod 2
