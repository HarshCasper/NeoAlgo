/*In Highway Billboard Problem, the main task is to place billboards on the highway such that
revenue is maximized. The possible sites for billboards on the highway
are given by number pos1 < pos2 < â€¦.. < posn-1 < posn, specifying positions in
miles measured from one end of the road to the other. If we place a billboard at
position pos[i], we receive a revenue of r[i] > 0. But we have a restriction here that
no two billboards can be placed within restricted mile number or less than that.*/

/*Sample Input/Output:
  Input:
        Enter array size for number of billboard sites: 5
        Enter positions in miles from one end to the other: 2 6 13 16 17
        Enter corresponding revenue generated for each position: 6 7 6 4 2
        Enter Distance for which you want revenue for: 15
        Enter mile restriction: 7

  Output:
        Maximum revenue that can be generated is: 12

 Time and space complexity for this approach:
 Time Complexity: O(N), where N is distance of total Highway.
 Auxiliary Space: O(N)
