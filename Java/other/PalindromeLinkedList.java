/* This program is to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome or not.
 And, A singly linked list is a linked list that can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node, i.e Unidirectional essentially.
 A string is said to be palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. 
 eg. racecar, madam etc.
