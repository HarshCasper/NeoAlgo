/*SELECTION SORT: 
    * inplace comparison-based sorting algorithm.
    * list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. 
    * The smallest element from the unsorted array is found and swapped with the leftmost element.
      ie, added to the sorted array. 
    * This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
