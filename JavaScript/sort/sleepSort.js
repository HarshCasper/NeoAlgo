/*
sleepSort -> It is a unique sorting technique in which javascript's  timeout function is used.
To know what timeout function is , refer to this article : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout

Drawbacks and constraints of sleepSort:
1. Sleepsort technique cannot be used in case of negative numbers, because it prints some unwanted result(unsorted array).
2. It might not be very useful in case of large integers in the array as large integers could cause a long duartion timeout. 
*/

let numbers = [10,50,3,7,1,75];

console.log("Sorted Array : ");
numbers.forEach(num => {

// Here creating timeout of duration  = element of array
  setTimeout(() => {console.log(num)}, num)     

});

// Output : 1 3 7 10 50 75

/*
Above code prints an unwamted result when array contains both 0 and 1 as its elemnnts,
i.e. 1 gets printed before 0 which is an unsorted condition, but to prevent this we can 
multiply the timeout with some constant e.g. 2*num or 3*num, but this can cause large timeout 
for some large elements of the array.
*/

let numbers2 = [10,50,3,7,1,75,0];

console.log("Sorted Array : ");
numbers2.forEach(num => {

// Here creating timeout of duration  = 2 * element of array 
  setTimeout(() => {console.log(num)}, 2*num)     

});

// Output : 0 1 3 7 10 50 75
