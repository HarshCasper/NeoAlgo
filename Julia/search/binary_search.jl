"""Julia program to implement Binary Search algorithm.
Binary Search is a Divide and Conquer strategy based algorithm, where the entire array is divided into two halfs and the
required element is searched for in one of these sections as per the conditions. It is done on sorted arrays.

SAMPLE I

How many numbers are present in the array? 5 
Enter the numbers: 1 2 3 4 5
Which number do you want to search in the array? 6
The number 6 is not present in the array

SAMPLE II

How many numbers are present in the array? 3
Enter the numbers: 3 1 2
Which number do you want to search in the array? 2
The number 2 is present in the array.
