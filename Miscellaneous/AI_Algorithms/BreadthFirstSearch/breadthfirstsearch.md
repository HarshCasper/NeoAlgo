- Uninformed Search Technique.
- Based on FIFO(first-in-first-out) eg. Queue.
- Also called as Level Search Technique because it moves level by level.
- Optimal solution is guaranteed, i.e., it gives the shortest cost.
- Time complexity(AI) = O(b^d)
     * b = branch factor(maximum children of a particular node)
     * d = depth
- Space Cpmplexity = Number of nodes traversed
