Step 1: SET STATUS = 1 (ready state)
for each node in G

Step 2: Enqueue the starting node A
and set its STATUS = 2
(waiting state)

Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until
QUEUE is empty

Step 4: Dequeue a node N. Process it
and set its STATUS = 3
(processed state).

Step 5: Enqueue all the neighbours of
N that are in the ready state
(whose STATUS = 1) and set
their STATUS = 2
(waiting state)

[END OF LOOP]

Step 6: EXIT
