Step 1: First we set the STATUS = 1 (status 1 is ready state) for each node in Graph.

Step 2: Then enqueue the starting node A and set its STATUS = 2 (status 2 is waiting state).

Step 3: Then we repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the QUEUE is empty(=null).

Step 4: Then we dequeue a node N, process it and set its STATUS = 3 (status 3 is processed state).

Step 5: Then we enqueue all the neighbouring nodes of node N that are in the ready state and we set their STATUS = 2.

Step 6: EXIT
