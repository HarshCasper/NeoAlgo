## ðŸŽ‰ Open source programs we have been a part of ðŸŽ‰
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. There are a lot of open source programs held throughout the year to encourage everyone's contribution and build awesome projects. NeoAlgo is such an open source organization and has participated in quite a few events like the following.
