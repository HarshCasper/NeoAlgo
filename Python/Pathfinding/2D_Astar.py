A* Algorithm: A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm,
        which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness,
        optimality, and optimal efficiency. Apart from other graph traversal techinques
        it has a previous knowledge of the target position. A* Algorithm has something
        called the heuristic function which helps in optimization of the algorithm.

Purpose: Given a binary matrix of N*M order where 0 is the wall and 1 is way.
        Find the shortest distance from a source cell to a destination cell,
        traversing through limited cells only. Also you can move only
        up, down, left and right. If found then print the distance and
        path in separate lines, else return -1.

Method : A*(Astar) Algorithm
Intuition: For implementation of the A* Algorithm, follow these steps
        1.  Initialize the open list
        2.  Initialize the closed list
            put the starting node on the open
            list (you can leave its f at zero)
        3.  while the open list is not empty
            a) find the node with the least f on
                the open list, call it "q"
            b) pop q off the open list
            c) generate q's 8 successors and set their
                parents to q
            d) for each successor
                i) if successor is the goal, stop search
                    successor.g = q.g + distance between
                    successor and q
                    successor.h = distance from goal to
                    successor (This can be done using many
                    ways, we will discuss three heuristics-
                    Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean Heuristics)
                    successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

                ii) if a node with the same position as
                    successor is in the OPEN list which has a
                lower f than successor, skip this successor

                iii) if a node with the same position as
                    successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
                    a lower f than successor, skip this successor
                    otherwise, add  the node to the open list end (for loop)

            e) push q on the closed list
                end (while loop)

Time Compexity:   O(N*M)
Space Complexity: O(N*M)

Argument: 2-d list, tupple, tupple (Maze, Source, Destination)
Return  : Integer, String          (Distance, Path)
