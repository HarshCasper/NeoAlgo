"""
Depth First Search: Its a graph traversal technique which uses
        stack data-structure fo its implementation. We extract the
        current node from the top of the stack and traverse its adjacent
        nodes. If not visited, we put the node at the top of the stack
        mark it as visited.
Purpose: Given a binary matrix of N*M order where 0 is the wall and 1 is the way.
        Find the shortest distance from a source cell to a destination cell,
        traversing through limited cells only. Also, you can move only
        up, down, left and right. If found then print the distance and
        path in separate lines, else return -1.

Method : Depth-First Search
Intuition : As we know stack is used for DFS. In recursion
        1. Initialize stack.
        2. Initialize 2d boolean array, the same size as the original array.
            This will help us in avoiding traversal to go in loops.
        3. Make a call to recursive function DFSUtil with row=0, column =0
            and visited[] array.
        4. In DFSutil Function, check if row and column indexes are within
            the range of given matrix and marked false in the visited[] array,
            if not then return from the function. If indexes are valid and not
            visited then print the element. Mark the element in the visited array.
            Make a recursive call to left(column-1), right(column+1), down(row+1)
            and up(row+1) from the current element position.

Time Complexity:   O(N*M)
Space Complexity: O(N*M)

Argument: 2-d list, tuple, tuple (Maze, Source, Destination)
Return  : Integer, String          (Distance, Path)
