"""
Rapidly-exploring Random Trees

Purpose: A robot is attempting to navigate its path from the start point to a specified goal region, 
        while avoiding the set of all obstacles.

Method: Using tree structure

Intuition:
In RRT, points are randomly generated within a specified radius 
and connected to the nearest existing node in a tree. 
Each time a node is created, we check that it lies outside of the obstacles. 
Furthermore, chaining the node to its closest neighbor must also avoid obstacles. 
The algorithm ends when a node is generated within the goal region, or a limit is hit.

Sample I/O: 

Input - 
start: 1 1
goal: 10 10

Output - 
A graph plotted using matplotlib with required path avoiding obtsacles, and the sampled points.

Time and Space Complexity: 

The time and space complexity are largely dependent on the number of nodes generated and the sample space used.
Here we have limited the number of iterations to 5000.
The choice of where to place the next vertex that you will attempt to connect to is the sampling problem. 
In simple cases, where search is low dimensional, uniform random placement works adequately. 

One problem with the RRT method is the nearest neighbour search time, which grows significantly 
when adding a large number of vertices.
Sampling strategies for RRTs are still an open research area.
