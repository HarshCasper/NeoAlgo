This program simulates a coin flip and outputs heads or tails. It is impossible to have 100 percentage randomness in classical world. The modules like randomm only creates pseudo randomness which means after a while there will be a pattern. Quantum world is 100 percentage random and probabilistic. So the output of this program will be random and will have equal probability.
