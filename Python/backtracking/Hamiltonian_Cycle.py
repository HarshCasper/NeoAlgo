"""
Hamiltonian Path: a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path
    in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly
    once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian
    path that is a cycle.

Problem Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path
Purpose: To determine the existance of a Hamiltonian Cycle in the provided
        undirected graph and return the path if such path exist.
        The nodes are numbered from 1 to N
Method : Backtracking

Time Complexity:  O(2^N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
Argument : Graph (Dictionary)
Return   : Hamiltonian Cycle (List)
