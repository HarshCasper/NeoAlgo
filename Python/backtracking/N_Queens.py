'''
Purpose: To place N queens in a N*N Chessboard such that no two queens
        attack each other. A queen is said to be attacked by another queen
        if they share same diagonal(right/left), Row or Column.
Problem Link:- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle
Method: Backtracking
Intution: Since there could be only one queen in each row, we can assume the
          N*N chessbord to be a 1d array which each index denotes one of the
          row and the row value denotes the column. Now in each row, we will
          put a queen and check wether it is possible or not. If possible, then
          we recursively check for the next row. If its not possible to place
          a queen in any of the column is a particular row, then we backtrack
          and try next Column.

Time Complexity:  O(2^N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Argument: Integer ( Size of the Chessboard)
Return  : List    ( Possition of individual queens)/ False
