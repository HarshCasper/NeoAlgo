"""
    Takes an array of integers sorted in ascending order, a target value and
    finds the starting and ending position of a given target value.

    Approach - Binary Search:

    Binary search follows divide and conquer approach in which,
    the list is divided into two halves and the item is compared
    with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then,
    the location of middle element is returned otherwise,
    we search into either of the halves depending
    upon the result produced through the match.
