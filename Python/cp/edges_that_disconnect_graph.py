# Intuition:
# We can solve this in many ways , one of the approaches could to check connectivity with
# respect to each and every edge --> Time complexity O(Eâˆ—(V+E)) but it might
# not be an effective solution
# In this approach we are using the Trajan's Algorithm
# --> some of the observations which are going to be helpful
# *  a edge between two parts(subgraphs) of a graph can be a bridge
#  only if there exists no back-edge from one of the subgraphs to the
#  other i.e this edge is the only way we can connect different nodes
#  from these two subgraphs
# *  we should not consider the edge connecting the
#  parent and the child as a ** back edge **
# * to identify a back edge --> the lowest link of
# a node should should have a lesser value than its parent.
# if not such a node is a bridge
# if lowest_link[v] > seenAt[u]:
#      bridges.append((u, v))
# -->seenAt this array contains the value  for each node which
#  corresponds to the time at which we have seen that node this
#  remains constant throught the algorithm
# -->lowest_link this array contains the value for each node
#  which corresponds to  the lowest seenAt value node which is
#  accessible by this node
# -->parent array contains the parent for each node
# --> bridges contains the edge(vertex-pairs) which are the bridges
#  [ not necessary for the question , can be used to understand the answer better]
# -->time this is the variable which contains the seenAt time which increases
# by one for each recursive call
# Implementation:
# The implementation contains the use of the Trajan's Algorithm.
# along with some modifications made to accommodate the the conditions
# --> parent child edge exclusion
# --> back-edge detection
