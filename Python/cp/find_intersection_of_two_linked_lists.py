Introduction 
There are two singly linked lists in a system
Write a program to get the point where two linked list merge. 
If they do not merge , print that the given lists do not merge
        
Argument/Return Type
Input are taken as two lists , 
contaning the data of each node of a Linked List inorder seperated by space 
Data of the interection node is printed as out put , if they intersect
If the given Linked Lists do not intersect, a statement which says that is printed

# A Linked List Node

Sample Test Case      

Input Format : 
Example :
Enter the values of each node of Linked List 1 in order : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Enter the values of each node of Linked List 2 in order : 5 4 3 4 5 6 7   

Output Format :
Example : ( Output to the above input example ) 
Linked List 1 = 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->None
Linked List 2 = 5->4->3->4->5->6->7->None
The intersection point is 3

Corner Test Cases Result
Code works fine for all corner test cases tested , including null linked lists.

Time/Space Complexity
Time Complexity : O(m+n)
  where m and n are size of two linked lists
Space Complexity : O(1)
  No additional space is required
