Ugly Number : Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors
         are 2, 3 or 5. By convention, 1 is included.The sequence
         1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, … shows the first
         11 ugly numbers.

Purpose: Return the Nth smallest Ugly Number
Method:  Dynamic Programing
Intution: The ugly-number sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, …
     because every number can only be divided by 2, 3, 5, one way to 
     look at the sequence is to split the sequence to three groups as below:
     
        (1) 1×2, 2×2, 3×2, 4×2, 5×2, …
        (2) 1×3, 2×3, 3×3, 4×3, 5×3, …
        (3) 1×5, 2×5, 3×5, 4×5, 5×5, …

      We can find that every subsequence is the ugly-sequence itself 
      (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …) multiply 2, 3, 5. Then we use similar merge method as
      merge sort, to get every ugly number from the three subsequence.
      Every step we choose the smallest one, and move one step after.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Argument: Integer
Return  : Integer (Nth smallest Ugly Number)
