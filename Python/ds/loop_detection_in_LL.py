PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Given a linked list, the task is to find whether the linked list consists of
a loop or not.
The user will enter the elements in a linked list and will specify whether
the tail of the linked list is pointed to some other node or to NULL.
If the tail is pointing to NULL, the user will input -1 in 'pos' variable,
otherwise, the user will input the index of the node to which the tail pointer
will point.
'pos' variable is only used to create a linked list as per the data entered
by the user, and is not passed to the function for detecting a loop,
it is being detected by using Floyd's cycle detection algorithm.
