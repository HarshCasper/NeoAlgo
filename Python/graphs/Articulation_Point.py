Articulation Point:- In an undirected graph, any vertex whose removal
        from the graph separates/divides the graph into 2 or more graph
        which are not connected by any edge is called a cut-vertex
        or Articulation Point.

Purpose:- To return a list of all Articulation point in the given
            graph if such point exists.
Problem Link:- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/articulation-points-or-cut-vertices-in-a-graph

Method - Depth First Search
Intution:- The idea behind the solution is to use DFS because it forms DFS tree.
        In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true.
        1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two children.
        2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that
            no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one
            of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u.

Time Complexity:-  O(N+M)
Space Complexity:  O(N)

Argument: Dictionary ( Graph vertex numbered 1 to N)
Return  : List       ( Articulation Point)
