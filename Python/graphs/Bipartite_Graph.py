Bipartite Graph: A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be
        divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every
        edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex
        from V to U. A bipartite graph is possible if the graph
        coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices
        in a set are colored with the same color.

Purpose: To check whether the given undirected graph is Bipartite
        Graph or not.

Method: Breadth First Search (BFS)
Intution: Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph
        is Birpartite or not using Breadth First Search (BFS).

        1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U).
        2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V).
        3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U).
        4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all
            the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2.
        5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with
            same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with
            2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)

Time Complexity:  O(N+M)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Argument: Dictionary ( Graph where each vertex is numbered from 1 to N )
Reaturn : Boolean    ( The Graph is Bipartite or not )
