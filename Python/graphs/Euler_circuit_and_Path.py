''' Euler-circuit-and-Path  '''
'''
Problem Statement :Eulerian Path is a path in graph that
                   visits every edge exactly once.
                   Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian
                   Path which starts and ends on the
                   same vertex.
                   The task is to find that there
                   exists the Euler Path or circuit
                   or none in given undirected graph.

Input :First line consists of test cases T. First
       line of every test case consists of 2
       integers V and E, denoting the number of
       vertex and edges. Second line of every test
       case consists of 2*E spaced integers denoting
       the edge connected.


Output :Return the int value to print 1 if Euler path
        exists print 2 if Euler cycle exists else 0.
