"""
Strongly Connected Components : A directed graph is strongly connected
        if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. A strongly
        connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal
        strongly connected subgraph.

Purpose: To find all the Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in the
        given directed graph.

Method: Kosaraju's Algorithms / Double DFS
Intution: We can find all strongly connected components in O(N+M) time
        using Kosaraju’s algorithm. Following is detailed Kosaraju’s algorithm.

        1) Create an empty stack ‘S’ and do DFS traversal of a graph.
            In DFS traversal, after calling recursive DFS for adjacent
            vertices of a vertex, push the vertex to stack.
        2) Reverse directions of all arcs to obtain the transpose graph.
        3) One by one pop a vertex from S while S is not empty. Let the
        popped vertex be ‘v’. Take v as source and do DFS (call DFSU(node)).
        The DFS starting from v prints strongly connected component of v.

Time Complexity:  O(N+M)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Argument: Dictionary ( Graph with each node numbered from 1 to N)
Return  : List       ( List of diffrent Strongly Connected Components)
