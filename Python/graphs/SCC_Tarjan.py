Strongly Connected Components : A directed graph is strongly connected 
        if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. A strongly 
        connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal 
        strongly connected subgraph.

Purpose: To find all the Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in the
        given directed graph.
Method: Tarjan's Algorithm / Depth First Search
Intution: Tarjan Algorithm is based on following facts:
        1. DFS search produces a DFS tree/forest
        2. Strongly Connected Components form subtrees of the DFS tree.
        3. If we can find the head of such subtrees, we can print/store all 
            the nodes in that subtree (including head) and that will be one SCC.
        4. There is no back edge from one SCC to another (There can be cross
        edges, but cross edges will not be used while processing the graph).

Time Complexity:  O(N+M)
Space Complexity: O(N)

Argument: Dictionary ( Graph with each node is numbered from 1 to N)
Reaturn : List       ( Strongly Connected Components)
