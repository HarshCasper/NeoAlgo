Top view of binary tree

Given a binary tree, print the nodes in left to right manner as visible from
above the tree.Input is given in order of left child root then
right child(preorder).
For e.g. 1 2 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 3 6 -1 -1 -1
Tree looks like
              1
          /      \
      2           3
    /     \       /
  4       5     6

nodes '5' and '6' will be overlapped by '1' as seen from above,
so when viewed from the top , we would see the nodes 4, 2, 1 and 3.

Sample Input:
Enter values in a binary tree:
1
2
4
-1
-1
5
-1
-1
3
6
-1
-1
-1
Sample Output:
Top view of the binary tree is: 4 2 1 3

Time Complexity:  O(n), for traversing the 'n' nodes

Space Complexity: O(1), since no extra space is used
