Problem Statement : To find Hamming Distance between two numbers.

What is Hamming distance? The hamming distance is the value differ in two
                          binary representations as a 32-bit integer.

Intution: If num1 = 7(0111) and num2 = 8(1000), the bit differance between 
          these two numbers will be 4.

Return  : Differnce in binary representation between two numbers.

Sample Input / Output:

Enter 1st number: 7
Enter 2nd number: 8
Hamming distance between these two numbers is:  4

Enter 1st number: 1
