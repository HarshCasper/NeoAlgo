8 PUZZLE PROBLEM SOLVING USING A* ALGORITHM

An instance of the n-puzzle game consists of a board holding n^{2}-1 
distinct movable tiles, plus an empty space. The tiles are numbers from 
the set 1,..,n^{2}-1. For any such board, the empty space may be legally 
swapped with any tile horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. In this 
assignment, the blank space is going to be represented with the number 0. 
Given an initial state of the board, the combinatorial search problem is 
to find a sequence of moves that transitions this state to the goal state; 
that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending order 
0,1,..,n^{2}-1.

So, this is the goal state that we want to reach:
[1, 2, 3]
[8, 0, 4]
[7, 6, 5] 

The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the 
initial state. The blank space may be swapped with a component in one of 
the four directions {‘Up’, ‘Down’, ‘Left’, ‘Right’}, one move at a time.

A* algorithm has 3 parameters:
g: the cost of moving from the initial cell to the current cell.
h: also known as the heuristic value, it is the estimated cost of moving from 
   the current cell to the final cell. The actual cost cannot be calculated until 
   the final cell is reached. Hence, h is the estimated cost. We must make sure 
   that there is never an over estimation of the cost.
f: it is the sum of g and h. So, f = g + h
We always go to the state that has minimum 'f' value.
