8 PUZZLE PROBLEM SOLVING USING BREADTH FIRST SEARCH

An instance of the n-puzzle game consists of a board holding n^{2}-1 
distinct movable tiles, plus an empty space. The tiles are numbers from 
the set 1,..,n^{2}-1. For any such board, the empty space may be legally 
swapped with any tile horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. In this 
assignment, the blank space is going to be represented with the number 0. 
Given an initial state of the board, the combinatorial search problem is 
to find a sequence of moves that transitions this state to the goal state; 
that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending order 
0,1,..,n^{2}-1.

So, this is the goal state that we want to reach:
[1, 2, 3]
[8, 0, 4]
[7, 6, 5] 

The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the 
initial state. The blank space may be swapped with a component in one of 
the four directions {‘Up’, ‘Down’, ‘Left’, ‘Right’}, one move at a time.

Algorithm Review:
The search begins by visiting the root node of the search tree, given by 
the initial state. Among other book-keeping details, three major things 
happen in sequence in order to visit a node:
-First, we remove a node from the frontier set.
-Second, we check the state against the goal state to determine if a 
 solution has been found.
-Finally, if the result of the check is negative, we then expand the node. 
 To expand a given node, we generate successor nodes adjacent to the current 
 node, and add them to the frontier set. Note that if these successor nodes 
 are already in the frontier, or have already been visited, then they should 
 not be added to the frontier again.
