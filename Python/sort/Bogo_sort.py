"""
BogoSort is also known as permutation sort, and/or stupid sort.
Imagine throwing a pile of cards, and then search for 2 pre-determined cards.
You pick 2 cards, match them if they are the ones you need, if not, you throw them back in the pile.
Pick 2 cards again, match them till you get the required pair. Yes it is stupid, slow and depends upon Luck.

The algorithm successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted.
