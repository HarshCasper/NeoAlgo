# Program to implement QuickSort Algorithm in Python


'''
    This function takes last element as pivot, places  the pivot element at its correct position in sorted  array, 
    and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of pivot and all greater elements to right  of pivot
'''
def partition(arr,low,high):
    '''
        The value of i is initialized to (low-1) since initially first element is swapped by itself 
	Reason: no greater element has been encountered apart from itself
    '''
    pivotElement = arr[high]
    i = (low - 1)
    
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivotElement:
            i += 1
            
            # swap elements arr[i] and arr[j]
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    
    # swap pivot element with element at index=(i + 1) since loop ended, to obtain LHS of pivot
    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    
    return(i + 1)
