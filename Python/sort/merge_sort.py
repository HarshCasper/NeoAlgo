"""
Merge Sort Algorithm Implementation in Python 3

Purpose:
It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks
down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single
element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

Methodology:
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Time Complexity:  O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Note:
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n)
to hold additional elements from B.
The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
