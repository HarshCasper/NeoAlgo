In this we are required to find the maximum subarray sum of an array which can comprise both positive as well as negative numbers, by making use of prefix sum array. 
This approach uses Dynamic Programming and Prefix Sum to find out maximum subarray sum in Linear time.

Alternate approach could be to use Kadane's algorithm using O(1) extra space.

Time Complexity : O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Sample Input: 
1   // no. of test cases
9   // size of array
-2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4 

Sample Output: 
6
