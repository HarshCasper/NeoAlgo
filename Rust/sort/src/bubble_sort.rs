//! # Bubble Sort
//!
//! Bubble Sort is one of the easiest sorting algorithms. We go through the array 1 element at a
//! time, and swap any 2 elements that are out of order. We do so repetitively until array is
//! sorted. It can be seen that it will take at most `n` iterations, where `n` is the length of the
//! array. An intuitive proof is that the first time the largest value 'bubbles' up to the last,
//! the next time the second largest element 'bubbles' up and so on.
//!
//! ## Input
//!  Simply enter the array
//!
//! ## Output
//!  The sorted version of that array

fn bubble_sort<T>(arr: Vec<T>) {
