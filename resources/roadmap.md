# Roadmap for learnig DSA

This roadmap is ade for beginners who might feel overwhelmed at the thought of learning so many data structures present out there. The main aim of this is to help guide you with resources about different data structures and how you can become good at acing data structures.

## INTRODUCTION

Sometimes learning to code can be pretty difficult and intimidating. Sometimes you might feel you’re not good enough but trust us, it happens and you'll get better with practice and time.
Let us start by exploring these wonderful articles and videos for some motivation. You can always come back to them if you feel lost!

## 100 DAYS OF CODE

For beginners, the idea of 100 days of code is treated as a nice initiative to help make a habit to code and learn to code in a span of 100 days.
If you are an absolute beginner, the following could be your guide to get started!.

### [DAY 1- 3]

Choose a programming language- there are many popular programming languages these days and you might feel confused or lost as to what programming language one should choose. If you are going to start competitive programming soon then C++ is the language you can learn because of its speed and the benefits it provides with its STL library.
Explore other programming languages and then choose a language best suited for you.

**_Resource_**

[Choose the right language for you](http://www.byte-by-byte.com/choose-the-right-language-for-your-coding-interview/)

### [DAY 4-14]

Learn the languages and get familiar with their syntaxes. This is important if you want to make sure you code is bug free and you don't make mistakes writing the code.

**_Resources to learn languages_**

1. Python - [Python Programming Language - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=lbp)
2. C++- [C++ Tutorial (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp)
3. JAVA- [Java Tutorial | Learn Java - javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-tutorial)

And also, if you are choosing C++, do not forget to learn STL because this will help you a lot in competitive programming.
[STL- C++ STL Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-stl-tutorial/)

### [DAY 15-40]

Learn DSA!. This is the most important aspect of any programming language because without dsa you will not be able to ace it. NeoAlgo was created with the aim to provide every data structure in every language so that people learning in different languages are benefitted !.

**_Start by learning algorithm complexity:_**

[Big O Notations (general quick tutorial) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6mKVRU1evU)

**_How to go about learning DS? Start in the following order:_**

1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Stack
4. Queue
5. Linked list
6. Trees
7. Heaps
8. Graphs

While learning dsa, check out the GitHub - [TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo: Bringing all Data Structures and Algorithms under one Roof ⚡](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo) repo and you can click on the language of your choice to see the implementation of the data structure you want!.

**_Resources_**

1. [Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (programiz.com)](https://www.programiz.com/dsa)
2. [Data Structures - GeeksforGeek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)

### [DAY 41- 50]

Solve the basic questions of that particular languages. These easy questions will help you with making a strong fundamental and basics and help you ahead. Don’t skip this step as it will give you problems ahead in intermediate and advanced topics. What are the basic questions and where to practice them?

**_Resources_**

1. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)- apply to filer of “easy” to solve beginner level questions

2. [Data Structures - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)- learn DSA, in the “practice” portal, apply the filter- basic
   Again, if you want to find the implementation of a data structure in some other language, you can come back to NeoAlgo repository.

### [DAY 51-59]

Time to learn some basic algorithms. Algorithms make our code easier and help working with them. You should also now start understanding about time complexity because this will determine the efficiency of your algorithm.

**_Algorithms to learn_**:

1. Sorting
2. Searching

**_Resources_**

1. [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/#AnalysisofAlgorithms) - GeeksforGeeks- for searching and sorting

### [DAY 60- 75]

Well done for reaching so far in this journey! It is hard to reach here and a lot of people might give up but you made it!. Now it is time to solve some medium level questions which you might need for interviews, competitive programming etc.

**_Resources_**

1. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - apply to filer of “medium” to solve medium level questions
2. [Data Structures - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)- learn DSA, in the “practice” portal, apply the filter- “intermediate”

### [DAY 76-100]

Time to learn algorithms and advanced dsa!. You might have already learnt algorithms like greedy, dynamic but if you haven’t it is time to learn them now!.
The algorithms you need to study are:

1. Greedy
2. Dynamic programming

**_Resources_**

1. [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) - GeeksforGeeks - for learning algorithms
2. [GitHub - TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo: Bringing all Data Structures and Algorithms under one Roof ⚡](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo) - for seeing implementation of different algorithms.

**_Dynamic programming_**
